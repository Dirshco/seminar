            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 abstract-title">1. Usage of Mobile Applications in Behavioral Health: A Systematic Literature Review</h2>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Introduction:</span> Mobile health (mHealth) applications are an emerging tool in behavioral health, offering new avenues for patient support and monitoring. This review aims to systematically analyze the efficacy, usability, and impact of mobile applications on patient outcomes in behavioral health settings.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Methods:</span> A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO using a predefined PICO framework. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, followed by full-text review, to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies published between 2015 and 2024. Data on application features, patient population, intervention type, and outcomes were extracted and synthesized.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Results:</span> The search yielded 45 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Key findings indicate that applications offering cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) modules and real-time monitoring significantly improved patient self-reported mood and adherence to treatment plans. However, significant heterogeneity was observed in study design and outcome measures, precluding a formal meta-analysis.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Conclusion:</span> Mobile applications show promise as a supplementary tool in behavioral health. Future research should standardize outcome measures and focus on long-term follow-up to better assess sustained clinical benefits.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 abstract-title">2. The Impact of Telemedicine on Patient-Physician Communication in Primary Care: A Systematic Review</h2>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Introduction:</span> The widespread adoption of telemedicine has reshaped patient-physician interactions. This systematic review evaluates the current evidence regarding how telemedicine modalities affect the quality of patient-physician communication in primary care settings.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Methods:</span> A search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL was performed for studies on telemedicine and communication published between 2018 and 2023. Studies were screened for relevance, and data was extracted on communication quality measures, including patient satisfaction, perceived empathy, and information exchange.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Results:</span> Our analysis of 32 included studies revealed mixed results. While some studies reported comparable communication quality in telemedicine and in-person visits, a significant number indicated challenges with non-verbal cues and establishing rapport. Qualitative synthesis identified a need for standardized training for physicians and patients on effective virtual communication.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Conclusion:</span> Telemedicine's effect on communication is complex. While convenient, it requires targeted strategies to preserve the quality of the patient-physician relationship.

            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Introduction:</span> Virtual reality (VR) offers an innovative non-pharmacological approach to pain management. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the efficacy of VR interventions in reducing pain levels among hospitalized patients.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Methods:</span> We searched major databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR interventions to standard care or placebo for pain management in hospital settings. A quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis of included RCTs was conducted to calculate the pooled effect size on pain scores.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Results:</span> Seven RCTs involving 500 patients were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain scores for patients in the VR group compared to control groups (Standardized Mean Difference = -0.65; 95% CI: -0.90 to -0.41). Subgroup analysis showed larger effects for procedural pain compared to chronic pain.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Conclusion:</span> VR is an effective adjunct therapy for pain management in hospitalized patients. Its implementation should be considered as part of a multi-modal pain strategy.

            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Introduction:</span> Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in medical diagnostics, particularly in image-rich specialties like dermatology. This review synthesizes the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms for common dermatological conditions.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Methods:</span> We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and arXiv for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of AI models (e.g., deep learning) for dermatological conditions. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) against a gold standard (e.g., histopathology or expert clinical diagnosis).
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Results:</span> Twenty-five studies were included, predominantly focusing on melanoma detection. The results consistently showed that AI algorithms achieved high levels of sensitivity and specificity, often comparable to or exceeding the performance of individual dermatologists. However, the lack of external validation and the risk of selection bias were noted as common limitations.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Conclusion:</span> AI shows remarkable accuracy in diagnosing dermatological conditions, but its integration into clinical practice requires further rigorous validation across diverse patient populations.

            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Introduction:</span> Adherence to hand hygiene protocols is crucial for preventing healthcare-associated infections. This review aims to identify and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of educational interventions designed to improve hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Methods:</span> A systematic search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was performed for studies evaluating educational interventions. The PRISMA flow diagram was used to document the study selection process. Data on intervention type, duration, and post-intervention compliance rates were extracted and narratively synthesized.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Results:</span> Our review of 40 studies indicated that multi-modal educational interventions (e.g., combining lectures with real-time feedback and reminders) were more effective than single-component interventions. The observed effect on compliance was often short-lived, highlighting the need for sustained, ongoing educational efforts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold section-heading">Conclusion:</span> Educational interventions can temporarily improve hand hygiene compliance. To achieve lasting change, a combination of educational, organizational, and technological strategies is likely required.
